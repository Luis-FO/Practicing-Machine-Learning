# Simple neuron class

The main idea here is to play with some basic principles applied in neural networks. Out of curiosity, I chose not to use functions such as sigmoid or relu, just the weight*x+bias pattern. The idea is to determine, for a set of points, the appropriate weight and bias value, that is, the equation of the straight line for this set of points.
